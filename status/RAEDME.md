# Status folder

Some commands vill run in the background. And to stop them we use status file to controll them.
Example we will start to record a video stream and keep on recording untill as long the file video is present in this folder.


# Danger
If you kill your program before we hade the files removed you may get into issues.
Clean this folder before startup.
